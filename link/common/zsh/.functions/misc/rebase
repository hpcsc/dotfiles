# assume remote name is origin, remote branch has the same name with local branch
# this git fetch command:
# - brings over the commits from origin/${TARGET_BRANCH}
# - updates local ${TARGET_BRANCH} if it's a fast-forward. If it's not a fast-forward, it will fail (because we don't use +/force in refspec)
# - for git 1.8.4 and above, updates refs/remotes/origin/${TARGET_BRANCH} according to the config from remote.origin.fetch

git fetch origin ${TARGET_BRANCH}:${TARGET_BRANCH}
